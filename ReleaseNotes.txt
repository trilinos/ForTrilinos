Release Notes for Trilinos Package ForTrilinos
----------------------------------------------

Trilinos 12.12
--------------

* First ForTrilinos v2 release

This marks the release of the new version of ForTrilinos. This version was
written from scratch and has no common code with the old ForTrilinos. It is
still in its early development and should be considered experimental, however it
provides a wide variety of features desired by users.

The new version of ForTrilinos specifically targets the new software stack of
Trilinos to allow for MPI+X hybrid programming model.

ForTrilinos provides Fortran interfaces for the following capabilities:
- Parameter lists and XML parsers (through Teuchos);
- Distributed linear algebra object including sparse graphs, sparse matrices, and dense vectors (through Tpetra);
- Linear solvers and preconditioners (through Stratimikos, Ifpack2, Belos, MueLu);
- Eigen solvers (through Anasazi).

ForTrilinos requires Fortran2003 capable compiler. It has been tested with
gfortran and flang.

The developement is being done on github.com/Trilinos/ForTrilinos. If you have
any questions, requests for new features, or would like to report a bug, please
file an issue there.

Trilinos 10.4.1:
----------------

 (*) This release includes 11 modules or classes of the Epetra package.

 (*) This package is still in its experimental stage and is only supported on AIX.

 (*) Sample configure script are provided in Trilinos/sampleScripts/aix-fortrilinos-serial
     and Trilinos/sampleScripts/aix-fortrilinos-mpif90 for serial and mpi builds respectively.
 
 (*) Because of the object-oriented features used, it requires a XL Fortran compiler v13.1.
     The source code can be compiled using the xlf compiler option.

 (*) Required compiler flags for Fortran include:
       -qfixed=72 -qxlines:   deals with older Fortran source code in other Trilinos packages.
                              These flags are used for mpi builds and must be specified in 
                              the configure script.
       -qxlf2003=polymorphic: allows for the use of polymorphism in the source code.
       -qxlf2003=autorealloc: allows the compiler to automatically reallocate the left hand
                              side with the shape of the right hand side when using allocatable
                              variables in an assignment.
       -qfree=f90:            informs the compiler that the source code is free form and 
                              conforms to Fortran 90.

     These flags(-qfree=f90 -qxlf2003=polymorphic -qxlf2003=autorealloc) are hardcoded
     in Trilinos/packages/ForTrilinos/CMakeLists.txt

 (*) Required compiler flag for xlc++ include:
       -qrtti=all:            this flag should be included in the configure script.

 (*) The project is primarily user-driven; so new interfaces are developed at the request of Trilinos users.
