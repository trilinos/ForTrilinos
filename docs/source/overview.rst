Getting started with ForTrilinos
================================

Overview
--------

`ForTrilinos <https://github.com/trilinos/ForTrilinos>`_ is an
open-source software library providing object-oriented Fortran interfaces to `Trilinos <https://trilinos.org>`_ C++
packages.

The original implementation of the ForTrilinos was developed prior to 2012. That code is no longer developed and
maintained, and is available in the `master` branch.

The new implementation using SWIG code generation started in late 2016 and is currently under active development. At the
moment, it is not fully ready for public consumption as the code and interfaces may change rapidly and backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed. However, interested parties could check it out in the `develop` branch.
