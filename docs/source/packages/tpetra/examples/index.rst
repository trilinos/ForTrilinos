.. note::

   The Tpetra examples are not intended to be lessons on the theory and use of Tpetra linear algebra objects.  They are intended only to demonstrate implementation of operations commonly performed on Tpetra objects using the ForTrilinos interface.  See the Tpetra `documentation <https://trilinos.org/docs/dev/packages/tpetra/doc/html/index.html>`_ and `lessons <https://trilinos.org/docs/dev/packages/tpetra/doc/html/index.html#tpetra_tutorial>`_ for more background on Tpetra theory and usage.
